# Turtle Animation

https://vincentwings.github.io/Turtle-animation/

This code animates a turtle on a webpage using CSS transforms and an event listener for keyboard events. When the user presses an arrow key or the space key, the turtle moves or resets its position, respectively. The code uses a switch statement to determine the appropriate action based on the key that was pressed.

To use the animation, click on the link and use the following keys to control the turtle:

ArrowUp: moves the turtle up
ArrowDown: moves the turtle down
ArrowLeft: moves the turtle left and flips it horizontally
ArrowRight: moves the turtle right and flips it horizontally
Space: resets the turtle's position and orientation to its original state
Any other key press will have no effect.
